## Using the Custom Embed Section

The page includes a dedicated section for embedding custom HTML/CSS. You can use it in several ways:

### Method 1: Direct HTML Editing
Edit `index.html` and replace the content inside:
```html
<div class="custom-content-area" id="customContentArea">
    <!-- Your custom HTML here -->
</div>
```

### Method 2: JavaScript Loading
Add a script tag to dynamically load content:
```javascript
document.getElementById('customContentArea').innerHTML = 
    '<div>Your custom HTML here</div>';
```

### Method 3: External Content
Load content from another source using JavaScript fetch or iframe.

## Customization

Feel free to customize:
- Colors in `styles.css` (search for `#667eea` and `#764ba2` for the gradient colors)
- Site title and tagline in `index.html`
- Add more sections or pages as needed

Enjoy your new GitHub Pages site! ðŸŽ‰
